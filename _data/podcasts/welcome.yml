  <p>Sitcom about an alien invasion of a small village.</p>
  <p>
  Katrina Lyons was only visiting Cresdon Green, the village where she grew up, to borrow some money from her parents. But when she tried to head back to London, it turned out alien beings known as the Geonin had lowered a force field around the village and were refusing to let anyone in or out.
  </p>
  <p>
  Unfortunately almost everyone in the village is too cowardly, apathetic, polite or stupid to stand up to this alien menace, so Katrina has no choice but to start the resistance movement herself. In the cricket pavilion.

      <p>
      The force field around the village is keeping out all the rain, so the villagers can no longer moan about the weather. Uljabaan realises this means they're moaning about him instead. Whilst he tries to construct a device to simulate rain inside the force field, Uljabaan distracts the village with a cricket match - aliens versus humans, with Richard captaining the humans. Katrina sees an opportunity to sabotage Uljabaan's computer - if she can keep the match going long enough.

      Uljabaan is working on an education programme for after the invasion, creating a list of books suitable for children to read. His chosen advisor is Mrs Leeson from the charity shop. Katrina is confident she could do a better job, and hopes she could use it for subversive purposes - so she volunteers. But can she sneak anything past Uljabaan? And can she convince Lucy she's not really being a traitor?

      Uljabaan is busy with a construction project and asks Margaret to help with some routine duties in the village - collecting data, checking up on the man they put down the old well, that sort of thing. Katrina is dismayed - he's too busy to oppress the humans, so he's getting them to do it to each other. But the construction project involves opening up the force-field that surrounds the village. Can Katrina and Lucy sneak a message into the outside world?<br/>

      Uljabaan's superior officer Gryvook is coming for an assessment visit. Uljabaan is hoping to get the go-ahead to invade the rest of Earth - but first he has to prepare a welcome banquet. Tradition dictates he should serve a human child... which could create an awkward atmosphere in the village. Meanwhile Richard is helping him with the invasion budget, and the figures just aren't adding up. It seems set to be a disaster - can Katrina exploit this to get the invasion cancelled permanently?

      1/6: Counter Plot. In this first episode of the series, Richard is alarmed to discover that Uljabaan has commandeered six allotments for some sort of experiment, while Katrina is more concerned that he's arrested Lucy. But what kind of plants is he planting inside the building he has built?

      Welcome To Our Village, Please Invade Carefully is a sitcom about an alien race that have noticed that those all-at-once invasions of Earth never work out that well. So they've locked the small Buckinghamshire village of Cresdon Green behind an impenetrable force-field in order to study human behaviour and decide if Earth is worth invading.

      The only inhabitant who seems to be bothered by their new alien overlord is Katrina Lyons, who was only home for the weekend to borrow the money for a deposit for a flat when the force-field went up. So along with Lucy Alexander (the only teenager in the village, willing to rebel against whatever you've got) she forms The Resistance - slightly to the annoyance of her parents Margaret and Richard who wish she wouldn't make so much of a fuss, and much to the annoyance of Field Commander Uljabaan who, alongside his unintelligible minions and The Computer (his hyper-intelligent supercomputer), is trying to actually run the invasion.

      4/6: CTRL-ALT-DEL. The Computer catches a virus - in fact, it's probably the most common virus on Earth. With Uljabaan's sole method of control, analysis and communication now compromised, the invasion is doomed in more ways than one.

      5/6: Testing Times. It's the day after Lucy's eighteenth birthday, and her parents aren't happy, and not only because she took that bottle of rum from their drinks cabinet. They think she is wasting her life being part of the resistance, so unless she can pass her A Levels they're going to stop her coming to the meetings. Does it really take a village to raise a child? Or will they make things worse?
