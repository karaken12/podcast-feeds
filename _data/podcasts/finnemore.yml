description: John Finnemore, writer and star of Cabin Pressure, regular guest on The Now Show and popper-up in things like Miranda and That Mitchell and Webb Look returns with half an hour of his own sketches, each funnier than the last. Although, hang on, that system means starting the whole series with the least funny sketch. Might need to rethink that. OK, it's a new show filled with sketches written and performed by John Finnemore, but now no longer arranged in strict order of funniness. Also, he's cut the sketch that would have gone first.

      John Finnemore, the writer and star of Cabin Pressure; regular guest on The Now Show; and popper-upper in things like Miranda and Family Guy, presents a special edition of his sketch show, recorded at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
      <br/>
      The first series, broadcast last year, was described as "sparklingly clever" by The Daily Telegraph and "one of the most consistently funny sketch shows for quite some time" by The Guardian. It featured Winnie the Pooh coming to terms with his abusive relationship with honey; how The Archers sounds to people who don't listen to the Archers, and Jekyll and Hyde's tricky housekeeping arrangements. This show won't feature any of those things, but that's ok, because it will feature other things, and they'll be funny too.
      <br/>
      John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme is written by and stars John Finnemore, with Margaret Cabourn-Smith, Simon Kane, Lawry Lewin and Carrie Quinlan.

      John Finnemore, the writer and star of Cabin Pressure, regular guest on The Now Show and popper-upper in things like Miranda and Family Guy, records a second series of his hit sketch show.
      <br/>
      The first series was described as "sparklingly clever" by The Daily Telegraph and "one of the most consistently funny sketch shows for quite some time" by The Guardian. It featured Winnie the Pooh coming to terms with his abusive relationship with honey, how The Archers sounds to people who don't listen to the Archers and how Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde decided whose turn it was to do the washing up.
      <br/>
      This episode doesn't feature any of those things, but it does feature an awkward celestial relationship, surprisingly easy contract negotiations, and a trailer for a film about the only mode of transport that hasn't had a film made about it yet.

      Of those things, this episode includes another sketch about how the Archers sounds to people who don't listen to the Archers, as well a song about a dog and a sketch about a mathematician's agent.

Sorry, you know when you repeat a word so often it starts to go weird? "Sketch". Sketch! Ssssssketch. That's got it, better now. Anyway, there's a sketch about that.

      John Finnemore, the writer and star of Cabin Pressure, regular guest on The Now Show and popper-upper in things like Miranda, presents a third series series of his hit sketch show.
      <br/>
      The first series was described as "sparklingly clever" by The Daily Telegraph and "one of the most consistently funny sketch shows for quite some time" by The Guardian. The second series won Best Radio Comedy at both the Chortle and Comedy.co.uk awards, and was nominated for a Sony award.
      <br/>
      In this new series, John promises to stop doing silly sketches about nonsense like Winnie the Pooh's honey addiction or how goldfish invented computer programming, and concentrate instead on the the big, serious issues.
      <br/>
      This first episode of the series addresses the kind of animals that don't get sanctuaries; why the train manager needs to see the train driver; and why people literally shout at the radio?
      <br/>
      Written by and starring John Finnemore, with Margaret Cabourn-Smith, Simon Kane, Lawry Lewin and Carrie Quinlan. Original music is by Susannah Pearse.

      1/6: This first edition of the brand-new series sees John create an innovative teaching aid; eavesdrop on two guards who really should be paying more attention; and, well, since you ask him for a tale of honour satisfied, he does have one such sketch.

      <br/>
      In this fourth series, John has written more sketches, like the sketches from the other series. Not so much like them that they feel stale and repetitious; but on the other hand not so different that it feels like a misguided attempt to completely change the show. Quite like the old sketches, in other words, but about different things and with different jokes. (Although it's a pretty safe bet some of them will involve talking animals.)
